Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You create a hidden .git folder that git uses to track changes and do the rest that it does.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is where you temporarily place the files that you are working on. You take these files from the working directory and you may commit them the repository if you are happy with the changes. Small change.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By adding to the staging are just the files containing the logical change.
