Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Primarily when I want to share my work with other, but also when I'd like to be able to easily access my work from multiple computers in different places.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

My changes might not be ready for public consumption. Pulling changes manually also give an opportunity for review.
